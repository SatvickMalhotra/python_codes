# Countdown Timer with Sound Effect⌛⌛⌛⌛

## Introduction ⩇⩇:⩇⩇
This is a Python script that allows you to set a countdown timer and play a sound effect when the time is up. It uses the `time` module to handle timing and the `playsound` library to play the sound effect.

## Usage ⩇⩇:⩇⩇
1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the `playsound` library. You can install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install playsound
    ```

2. **Choose a Sound Effect**: Replace `"your_sound_effect.mp3"` with the path to your desired sound effect file. Make sure the file is in a format supported by the `playsound` library (e.g., mp3).

3. **Run the Script**: Run the script in a Python environment. It will prompt you to enter the duration of the countdown in hours, minutes, and seconds.

4. **Wait for Completion**: The countdown will start, and you'll see the remaining time displayed. Once the countdown reaches zero, the specified sound effect will play.

## Example ⩇⩇:⩇⩇
```python
Enter hours (optional, press Enter to skip): 0
Enter minutes(optional, press Enter to skip): 0
Enter seconds: 10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Your time is up!
